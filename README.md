# City Trail

Similar to Oregon Trail where ESRI mapping, path finding, and
demographic data are used to create a realistic chase to the finish!
It is a multiplayer game where players have the goal to get to the
finish as fast as possible.

Uses:
 - AWS for hosting
 - ARCGIS heavily (described below)

## How do we use ARCGIS
 - Custom Mapping (We created our own Vector Theme)
 - Graphical Layer by drawing images and paths on map.
 - Route Finding and we limit path by current mode of travel
